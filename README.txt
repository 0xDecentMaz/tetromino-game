# tetromino-game
Simple tetromino game for learning purposes. 
Written in C using SDL2 library

ToDo: 
1. add border to window (hard to see the game boundries) 
2. add border to individual blocks (just for looks and learning) 
3. split up the code into their own headers based on category:
  1. Rendering
  2. Game logic
